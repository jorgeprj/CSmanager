# Counter Strike Manager (Under Development)

*"Counter Strike Manager"* is a team management and Counter Strike match simulation game developed in TypeScript. In this game, the player takes on the role of a team manager and is responsible for building a winning team, training them, managing finances, and competing in tournaments. The game combines elements of strategy, management, and simulation to provide an authentic Counter Strike team management experience.


## Overview
In *"Counter Strike Manager"*, you take on the role of a team manager and must build and train a team of Counter Strike players, plan and execute strategies and tactics to win games in championships and leagues, and evolve your team to the top of the global rankings.

The game is being developed in *TypeScript* and is still in the development phase.


## About the game

### Game Modes
The game will have two game modes: **Create Your Organization** and **Choose an Existing One**. In "Create Your Organization" mode, players will start with a basic team of players and have the task of managing all aspects of the team. In "Choose an Existing One" mode, players will have the option to choose an existing team to manage.

### Team Management Phase
In the management phase, players will have to make important decisions for their teams, including recruitment, training, tactics, finance, and marketing. Players must start with a limited budget and as their team becomes more successful, they will have access to more resources and sponsorships.

### Match Simulation Phase
In the match simulation phase, players will be able to follow their teams in realistic Counter-Strike matches. They will have the option to control the team and make tactical decisions or simply watch the match and see how their team performs. The game will feature detailed match statistics, allowing players to analyze their team's performance.

### Game Objectives
The goal of the game is to win the Major, creating a dynasty like the legendary teams *NIP*, *Fnatic*, *SK/LG*, *Astralis*, and *NAVI*. The progression of the game is measured by the team's position in the world ranking. The player must win matches and championships to rise in the ranking and qualify for bigger competitions.


## How to Run the Game
The game is still under development and there is **no playable version available**. However, it will soon be available for download.
